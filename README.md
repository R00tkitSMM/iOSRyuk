#Future Feature Plans as of 01/30/22 10:30AM central time: Add syscall table supprt, better variable renaming of IOKit functions and methods, fixup syscalls and oid list structs, automatically put externalMethod variable names.
Forked from original @bxl1989 who then was forked by @userlandkernel who then was forked by @turnerhackz1 aka me.
This tool was a core memory in my early days of reverse engineering and I loved this tool
but it the original person never made a iOS version he only released a macOS kernelcache version, userlandkernel proceeded to use that as a base guide
to make an iOS version, this was severely outdated as it was probably released around the ida 7.0 version time frame... With that being said
this tool is probably outmatched as well compared to ida_kernelcache which can pull through method names, symbols, and has a better all around 
parser in my opinion so most of you that come accross this will find this very pointless as it probably does the same if not less than
ida_kernelcache scripts by @bazad. I just didn't want my favorite script to be outdated and forgotten about 

This was updated to work with the ida pro 7.6 api, So anyhting below this currently will not work!
